Bugs
===
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Create puzzle prototype?
- Explore jQuery plugin functionality
- Enable "modes" i.e.: blocks are swapped and then selected is cleared (current), blocks are swapped and then the last selected block is the current.
=======

- Clicking too fast on the canvas can yield an undefined mouse position
- Selection and swapping seems a bit sluggish on Mozilla compared to Webkit based browsers

To Do
===

- Make entire puzzle scalable (Any size canvas can fit any size image, scale up or down and crop as needed)
- Disable mouse effect when hovering over a block that is already in place
