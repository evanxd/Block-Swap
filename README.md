About Block Swapper
===
Block Swapper is a JS experiment aiming to create a scalable (responsive), adapatable, cross-browser and device functioning puzzle script. The basic functionality should allow a user to "swap" pieces of a tile-based image puzzle.

The functionality of this script has been inherited from Rhuno's Puzzle tutorial - http://goo.gl/9StLQ
